# ASTR260_HW12

Problem 1: 

run AidanWalk_HW12_1 by executing python AidanWalk_HW12_1.py. This will save a plot to the local directory titled 'AidanWalk_HW12_1_Plot.png'. This is a histogram of the sum of a three dice roll, rolled 100,000 times.

Problem 2:

a) run AidanWalk_HW12_2b by executing python AidanWalk_HW12_2b.py. This will save a plot to the local directory titled 'AidanWalk_HW12_2b_Plot.png'. This will be an image of a dust particles movement due to brownian motion in a box. The darker a region is in the picture, the more times the dust visited that region. 

b) run AidanWalk_HW12_2c_animate by executing python AidanWalk_HW12_2c_animate.py, ensure that AidanWalk_HW12_2c.py is also located in the same directory, as AidanWalk_HW12_2c_animate calls functions from the AidanWalk_HW12_2c file. This will generate an animation of the brownian motion as described in a). There is a bug in this animation and the terminal must be closed to stop the never ending pop up figures from appearing.

Problem 3: 

run AidanWalk_HW12_3 by executing python AidanWalk_HW12_3.py. Be patient as this executtion takes just under a minute on my computer. The program will save a plot titled 'AidanWalk_HW12_3_Plot.png' to the local directory. This plot is of a simulation of radioactive decay of bismuth 213 over 20,000 seconds.
